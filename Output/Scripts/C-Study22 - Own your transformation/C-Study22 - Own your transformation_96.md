digital “twin” of an equipment piece. This allows engineers to perform  
a wide range of simulations and tests, at nominal incremental cost, and 
identify potential design defects much sooner in the cycle. This model-
based method also enables earlier validation of customer requirements.
ASTRI estimates that the twin approach has reduced integration time by
