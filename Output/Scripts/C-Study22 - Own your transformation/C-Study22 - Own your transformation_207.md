The result is data-led innovation that can improve sustainability outcomes, 
increase visibility in supply chain workflows ecosystem-wide, and accelerate  
hybrid cloud adoption for real-time decisions and actions (see Figure 17).  
In short, data-led innovation can help CSCOs navigate that ever-present  
tightrope of managing the present while preparing for the future.
